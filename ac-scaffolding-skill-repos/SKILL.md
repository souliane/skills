# Skill Repo Boilerplate

Scaffold a new AI agent skill repository with a consistent structure, quality tooling, and pre-commit hooks — or update an existing repo to align with current best practices.

## Dependencies

Standalone. If `find-skills` is available, use it to check if a similar skill already exists before scaffolding.

This skill works alongside the agent's native skill system. Skills created here are compatible with slash command discovery — each `SKILL.md` is auto-detected when symlinked into the active agent runtime's skills directory.

## When to Use

- User wants to create a new skill from scratch
- User wants to create a new skill repo (a collection of skills)
- User wants to align an existing skill repo with current best practices

## Mode Detection

Before starting, determine the mode:

1. Check for existing `SKILL.md` files, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `pyproject.toml` in the target directory.
2. If **none exist** → **Scaffold mode** (§§ 1–9 below).
3. If **any exist** → **Update mode** (§ 10 below). Tell the user: "Detected an existing skill repo. Switching to update mode — I'll audit each config area and propose changes individually."

## Template Repository

A ready-to-use template repo is available at [souliane/skill-repo-boilerplate](https://github.com/souliane/skill-repo-boilerplate). It includes all the config files, hooks, scripts, and directory structure described below.

### Quick Start from Template

For a **skill repo** (collection of skills), the fastest path is to fork the template:

```bash
# Fork on GitHub first, then clone your fork:
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/my-skills.git ~/workspace/my-skills
cd ~/workspace/my-skills

# Add the boilerplate as upstream for future updates:
git remote add boilerplate https://github.com/souliane/skill-repo-boilerplate.git
```

Then customize: rename `my-skill/` to your skill name, update `pyproject.toml` project name, and edit the template `SKILL.md`.

### Retro-basing an Existing Repo on the Boilerplate

To align an existing skill repo with the boilerplate:

```bash
cd ~/workspace/existing-skills

# Add the boilerplate as a secondary remote:
git remote add boilerplate https://github.com/souliane/skill-repo-boilerplate.git
git fetch boilerplate

# Merge (allow unrelated histories for the first merge):
git merge boilerplate/main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve conflicts — keep your content, adopt boilerplate config where it's better.
# Then commit the merge.
```

### Keeping Up to Date

Whenever the boilerplate gets updated:

```bash
git fetch boilerplate
git merge boilerplate/main
```

Conflicts are expected when you've customized config files — resolve them by keeping your project-specific values and adopting any new boilerplate improvements.

## Scaffold Mode

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask the user **one question at a time** (wait for each answer before asking the next). Auto-detect and propose defaults where possible:

1. **Skill name** — kebab-case, descriptive (e.g., `ac-adopting-ruff`, `ac-generating-slides`)
2. **Purpose** — one-sentence description
3. **Type:** single skill (one `SKILL.md`) or skill repo (collection of related skills)?
4. **Has Python scripts?** — some skills are pure markdown; others have scripts
5. **Target audience** — personal use, team, or public

### 2. Scaffold the Project

#### For a single skill (standalone)

```text
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              # The skill definition
├── .gitignore
└── README.md             # Brief description + install instructions
```

#### For a skill repo (collection)

```text
<repo-name>/
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .markdownlint-cli2.yaml
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── LICENSE
├── README.md              # Auto-generated skill catalogue
├── pyproject.toml         # Unified tool configuration
├── uv.lock
├── scripts/
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── check-banned-terms.sh
│   └── update_readme_skills.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── conftest.py
├── <skill-1>/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── <skill-2>/
    └── SKILL.md
```

### 3. SKILL.md

Read the [SKILL.md template](references/templates.md#skillmd-template) for the frontmatter spec, required fields, and starter template.

Key authoring guidelines (full details in the reviewing skill's [best practices reference](../ac-reviewing-skills/references/skill-authoring-best-practices.md)):

- Keep `SKILL.md` body under ~500 lines. Split into `references/` and `scripts/` when needed.
- Match instruction specificity to operation fragility (high freedom for judgment calls, low freedom for fragile sequences).
- When a workflow is deterministic, implement it as a callable script rather than prose.
- Build skills incrementally from observed agent failures, not speculatively.

### 4. Config Files

For skill repos with Python scripts, use the templates in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md):

- [pyproject.toml](references/templates.md#pyprojecttoml-template) — ruff (ALL rules), pytest (100% coverage), ty, codespell
- [.pre-commit-config.yaml](references/templates.md#pre-commit-config-template) — uv, ruff, ty, gitleaks, markdownlint, editorconfig, conventional commits, pytest
- [.markdownlint-cli2.yaml](references/templates.md#markdownlint-cli2yaml-template)
- [.editorconfig](references/templates.md#editorconfig-template)
- [README.md](references/templates.md#readme-template) — with auto-generated skills catalogue

### 9. Initialize

After scaffolding:

```bash
cd <repo-name>
git init
uv sync
prek install
prek run --all-files
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: scaffold skill repo"
```

---

## Update Mode

### 10. Audit and Propose Changes

When an existing repo is detected, walk through each config area below. For **each item**, compare the current state against the template, show the diff or missing piece, and **ask the user for confirmation before applying**. Never batch-apply changes.

#### 10.1 SKILL.md Frontmatter Audit

Scan all `*/SKILL.md` files in the repo. For each file, check against the frontmatter spec in § 3:

- **Missing `name`** → propose adding it (inferred from directory name)
- **`name` exceeds 64 chars or uses invalid characters** → propose a compliant name
- **Missing `description`** → propose adding a placeholder
- **`description` exceeds 1024 chars** → propose trimming
- **Description not in third person** → propose rewording
- **Description missing trigger phrases** (no "Use when..." pattern) → propose adding trigger phrases
- **Missing `compatibility`** → propose adding it
- **Missing `metadata.version`** → propose adding `version: 0.0.1`
- **Body exceeds ~500 lines** → propose splitting into reference files

Report findings as a table, then ask which to fix.

#### 10.2 README.md

Check for:

- **Missing `<!-- BEGIN SKILLS -->` / `<!-- END SKILLS -->` markers** → offer to add the skills catalogue section
- **Missing `scripts/update_readme_skills.py`** → offer to create it from template
- **Missing pre-commit hook `update-readme-skills`** → offer to add it (covered in § 10.4)

#### 10.3 pyproject.toml

Compare each section against the template in § 4:

- **Missing `[tool.ruff]`** → offer to add the full ruff config
- **Outdated ruff rules** (e.g., `lint.select` not set to `["ALL"]`, missing `per-file-ignores`) → offer to update, showing the diff
- **Missing `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`** → offer to add
- **Missing `[tool.ty]`** → offer to add the ty config
- **Missing `[tool.coverage.report]`** → offer to add
- **Missing `[tool.codespell]`** → offer to add

For each section, show what will be added/changed and wait for confirmation.

#### 10.4 .pre-commit-config.yaml

Compare hooks against the template in § 5:

- **Missing hooks** (e.g., no `codespell`, no `markdownlint-cli2`, no `editorconfig-checker`, no `ty-check`) → offer to add each one individually
- **Outdated hook revisions** → offer to update each, showing old → new
- **Missing `update-readme-skills` hook** → offer to add
- **Missing `banned-terms` hook** → offer to add
- **Missing script validation hooks** (`scripts-have-uv-shebang`, etc.) → offer to add

#### 10.5 .editorconfig

- **Missing entirely** → offer to create from template (§ 7)
- **Missing sections** (e.g., no `[*.py]` override) → offer to add

#### 10.6 .markdownlint-cli2.yaml

- **Missing entirely** → offer to create from template (§ 6)
- **Missing rules** compared to template → offer to add each

#### 10.7 .gitignore

- **Missing common patterns** (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.coverage`, `.pytest_cache/`) → offer to add

### Update Mode Rules

- **Never auto-apply changes.** Always show what will change and ask for confirmation.
- **Per-change granularity.** Each missing/outdated item is a separate confirmation.
- **Preserve user customizations.** When updating, merge rather than replace. If the user has extra ruff rules, keep them. If they have custom hooks, keep them. Flag conflicts rather than overwriting.
- **Skip irrelevant checks.** If the repo has no Python scripts, skip pyproject.toml Python-specific sections. If the repo has no `scripts/` directory, skip script validation hooks.

## Rules

- **Every skill MUST have YAML frontmatter** with at least `name` and `description` (see § 3 for the full spec).
- **Frontmatter `name` and `description`** must comply with the Agent Skills standard constraints (§ 3).
- **Scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`** for portability (never `#!/bin/bash`).
- **Python scripts targeting uv** should use `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` with inline metadata.
- **100% test coverage** is required for Python code.
- **Pre-commit hooks run on every commit** — never bypass with `--no-verify`.
- **No project-specific terms** in generic skills. Use `T3_BANNED_TERMS` in `~/.teatree` for enforcement.
