# OpenClaw Reference — read when troubleshooting or verifying installation

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's bad | Do this instead |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Binding gateway to `0.0.0.0` | Exposes OpenClaw to the internet without auth | Bind to `loopback`, use Tailscale Serve |
| Publishing Docker ports directly | Docker bypasses UFW — ports are public | Bind to `127.0.0.1`, add DOCKER-USER iptables rules |
| Using personal phone for Signal bot | Registering can de-auth your main Signal app | Get a dedicated SIM/number for the bot |
| Storing API keys in config files | Plaintext secrets on disk | Use `pass` or env vars sourced from encrypted store |
| Skipping `openclaw security audit` | Misconfigurations go unnoticed | Run `openclaw security audit --deep` after every config change |
| Running OpenClaw as root | Unnecessary privilege escalation | Create dedicated `openclaw` user |
| Asking all questions at once | Overwhelms the user | Ask ONE question, wait for answer, proceed |
| Not refreshing research before starting | OpenClaw evolves rapidly; cached data may be stale | Web search for latest version + breaking changes first |
| Running `curl \| bash` without verifying the script | Remote scripts can change between visits — supply chain risk | Download first (`curl -fsSL url -o install.sh`), inspect, then run. Reference files use vendor install commands for convenience but the agent should prefer download-then-inspect when practical |
| Skipping tool-use question | Security recommendation (Docker sandboxing) depends on whether user plans to use tools. Assuming chat-only leads to wrong advice | Always ask § 1.5 before security preferences |
| Moving on without confirming specific local model | User chose "BYOK + Ollama" but doesn't know which model will be installed | Explicitly confirm the model (e.g., "Qwen 3 4B on 4 GB — OK?") before proceeding |
| Generating a new SSH key without checking existing ones | User already has keys locally and/or registered with the provider | List `~/.ssh/*.pub` + provider keys first, ask which to use |
| Guessing API permission names instead of researching | Provider UIs change frequently; guessed names confuse the user | Web-search for the current UI or ask the user for a screenshot. The skill includes a snapshot but warns it may be stale |
| Not recommending dedicated account + restricted key + budget limit | Personal API key with full permissions is a security and billing risk | Always guide: dedicated account → service account → restricted permissions → budget limit |
| Not warning about Signal dedicated phone number during channel selection | User discovers too late (Phase 8) that they need a separate SIM | Warn in Phase 1.6 channel selection, not just Phase 8 |
| Not storing generated secrets in `pass` immediately | User can't retrieve the token later; secret only exists on the server | Every secret generated during setup (gateway token, API keys) goes into `pass` on the user's machine immediately |
| Not setting `gateway.mode` before starting gateway | Gateway refuses to start with "gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode" | Set `gateway.mode local` in Phase 5.3, before the systemd service is created |
| Not configuring `allowedOrigins` before user opens dashboard | User gets "origin not allowed" error | Configure `allowedOrigins` with the Tailscale/Cloudflare/Caddy hostname in Phase 5.3 |
| Not explaining device pairing before user hits "pairing required" | User sees cryptic error, doesn't know what to do | Warn the user before they open the dashboard, then approve the device with `openclaw devices approve` |
| Not fetching OpenClaw docs before starting installation | Agent guesses configs and commands, hits errors repeatedly | Fetch docs at the start of the install (Phase 5), not midway through debugging |

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Check |
|---------|-------|
| OpenClaw won't start | `openclaw doctor`, check Node version (`node -v` >= 22) |
| Gateway unreachable | `openclaw status`, check `systemctl status openclaw` |
| Channel not receiving messages | `openclaw channels status --probe` |
| Signal: daemon not reachable | `pgrep -af signal-cli`, check signal-cli HTTP port |
| WhatsApp: QR expired | Re-run `openclaw channels login --channel whatsapp` |
| Tailscale: can't reach dashboard | `tailscale status`, verify both devices on same tailnet |
| Docker bypasses firewall | Add DOCKER-USER iptables rules (see [`references/security-hardening.md`](references/security-hardening.md) § Docker + Firewall) |
| API key rate limited | OpenClaw auto-rotates keys; add backup keys with `_1`, `_2` suffixes |
| High memory usage (Ollama) | Check model size vs RAM; use smaller quantization or smaller model |
| SSH custom port not working (Ubuntu 24.04) | Ubuntu 24.04 uses systemd socket activation. Do NOT put `Port` directives in `sshd_config` — use a systemd socket override at `/etc/systemd/system/ssh.socket.d/override.conf` with explicit `0.0.0.0:PORT` and `[::]:PORT` format. Bare port numbers (e.g., `ListenStream=2222`) don't bind IPv4. Always keep the old port open in UFW until the new port is confirmed working from outside. |
| Locked out of SSH | Use `hcloud server enable-rescue <name> --ssh-key <key>` then `hcloud server reset <name>` to boot into rescue mode. Mount disk at `/mnt` via `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`, fix configs, unmount, disable rescue, reset. |

## When Using This Skill

### If online (web search available)

Before starting, refresh cached data AND fetch OpenClaw docs. This is non-negotiable — the skill caches configs and commands but OpenClaw releases daily and configs change.

**Fetch official docs (do this BEFORE Phase 5, not during debugging):**

1. Fetch `https://docs.openclaw.ai/install` — installation steps, post-install config
2. Fetch `https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security` — auth modes, allowedOrigins, token setup, Control UI pairing
3. Fetch `https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/tailscale` — Tailscale Serve config (if user chose Tailscale)
4. Fetch `https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/<channel>` — channel-specific setup (for Phase 8)

**Refresh version data via web search:**

1. `openclaw latest version release notes` — check for breaking changes vs cached v2026.3.13
2. `signal-cli latest release ARM64` — check if native aarch64 build is now available
3. `<provider> VPS pricing` — verify current prices for the user's chosen provider
4. `tailscale pricing free plan serve` — confirm Serve is still free
5. Update the `references/` files if any data changed. Note the new `last_updated` date.

### If offline (no web search)

This skill is designed to work offline using cached data in `references/`. All commands, configs, and version numbers are embedded. The main risk is that:

- OpenClaw version may have changed (releases daily)
- Pricing may have shifted
- signal-cli may have added ARM64 native builds

Proceed with cached data but **warn the user** that some info may be stale.

### Always

- **Adapt to the agent** — use the agent's native question/answer mechanism
- **After completion** — suggest `/t3-retro` (teatree) or equivalent retrospective to improve this skill
